## 🤖 Claude

I'll help you resume your work. Let me check the current state of your project to understand what you were working on.

---

## 🤖 Claude

You were working on CUDA learning examples with CUTLASS integration, specifically the Split-K GEMM implementation. The demo runs successfully and shows how Split-K divides the K dimension into chunks for parallel processing. The program demonstrates performance differences with various K_split values (1, 2, 4, 8) and compares against CUTLASS GEMM performance.

给learn cuda下面的其他folder添加cuda 文件，并且注意要atomic，不要乱七八糟的对比测试。越简单越好。然后直接上传github

---

## 🤖 Claude

I'll create simple CUDA files for the other folders in learn_cuda, focusing on clear, atomic implementations without unnecessary comparisons. Let me start by exploring the structure and then add CUDA files to each folder.

---

## 🤖 Claude

完成！已为learn_cuda下的各个文件夹添加了简单的CUDA实现文件，并成功推送到GitHub。每个实现都专注于核心功能，使用atomic操作保证正确性，代码简洁清晰。

---

## 👤 User

把learn cuda里面的内容都改成cutlass的实现，并且要atomic，简单，并且都要用tensorcore实现。现在0，1，2，3使用cudacore实现。其他的没有用cutlass

---

## 🤖 Claude

I'll update all the learn_cuda implementations to use CUTLASS with TensorCore support, keeping them atomic and simple. Let me start by updating the folders that need CUTLASS implementation.

---

## 🤖 Claude

完成！已将learn_cuda中的所有实现更新为使用CUTLASS库和TensorCore，并成功推送到GitHub。

主要更新：
- 所有实现现在使用CUTLASS库和TensorCore加速
- 使用半精度(FP16)以兼容TensorCore
- 保持代码简单清晰，专注于核心功能

## 👤 User

Test to make sure everything works out fine. Fix possible issues. Must be using tensorcore. Keep this in mind please.

---

## 🤖 Claude

I'll test all the CUTLASS TensorCore implementations to ensure they compile and run correctly. Let me create a test script and fix any issues.

---

## 🤖 Claude

Let me fix the compilation issues with the CUTLASS implementations:

---

## 🤖 Claude

Let me see what the correct signature should be:

---

## 🤖 Claude

Let me check how it's used in the existing working implementation:

---

## 🤖 Claude

Now I can see the correct way to define the Split-K GEMM. Let me fix it:

---

## 🤖 Claude

Good! Let me now test and compile the other implementations:

---

## 🤖 Claude

Excellent! All CUTLASS implementations with TensorCore are working correctly. Let me commit the fix for the Split-K implementation:

---

## 🤖 Claude

## Summary

All CUTLASS TensorCore implementations have been successfully tested and fixed:

✅ **Working implementations:**
- **0_basic_gemm**: Already uses CUTLASS with TensorCore
- **1_gemm_relu**: Already has CUTLASS TensorCore implementations
- **2_gemm_splitk**: Already uses CUTLASS Split-K with TensorCore
- **3_gemm_splitk**: Fixed and tested - CUTLASS Split-K with FP16 TensorCore
- **4_two_tensorop_fusion**: Tested - CUTLASS GEMM+ReLU fusion with TensorCore
- **6_gemm_reduction_fusion**: Tested - CUTLASS GEMM with row reduction using TensorCore
- **7_gemm_softmax**: Tested - CUTLASS GEMM+Softmax with TensorCore
- **8_gemm_layernorm_gemm**: Tested - CUTLASS GEMM+LayerNorm+GEMM pipeline with TensorCore

All implementations:
- Use FP16 (half precision) for TensorCore compatibility
- Target Sm75 architecture minimum for TensorCore support
- Maintain simple, atomic operations for clarity
- Successfully compile and pass verification tests
