https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/Lidar_AI_Solution/tree/d692b74265a6ebe309118f648acea5f871129afe/CUDA-CenterPoint Try extract spconv kernel from this repo. 

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'll help you extract the spconv (sparse convolution) kernels from the NVIDIA CUDA-CenterPoint repository. Let me start by fetching and analyzing the repository structure to identify the sparse convolution implementations.

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Let me fetch more detailed information about the spconv implementation:

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Now let me search for the actual CUDA kernel implementations. They might be in the main source directory:

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Let me check if there are actual kernel source files in the repository by looking at a broader view:

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Now let me extract all the header files:

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User

Please fetch and save the following header files from the NVIDIA CUDA-CenterPoint repository to local files:

1. Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/Lidar_AI_Solution/d692b74265a6ebe309118f648acea5f871129afe/CUDA-CenterPoint/3rdparty/libspconv/include/spconv/engine.hpp and save to spconv_extracted/include/spconv/engine.hpp

2. Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/Lidar_AI_Solution/d692b74265a6ebe309118f648acea5f871129afe/CUDA-CenterPoint/3rdparty/libspconv/include/spconv/tensor.hpp and save to spconv_extracted/include/spconv/tensor.hpp

3. Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/Lidar_AI_Solution/d692b74265a6ebe309118f648acea5f871129afe/CUDA-CenterPoint/3rdparty/libspconv/include/spconv/memory.hpp and save to spconv_extracted/include/spconv/memory.hpp

4. Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/Lidar_AI_Solution/d692b74265a6ebe309118f648acea5f871129afe/CUDA-CenterPoint/3rdparty/libspconv/include/spconv/check.hpp and save to spconv_extracted/include/spconv/check.hpp

5. Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/Lidar_AI_Solution/d692b74265a6ebe309118f648acea5f871129afe/CUDA-CenterPoint/3rdparty/libspconv/include/spconv/timer.hpp and save to spconv_extracted/include/spconv/timer.hpp

6. Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/Lidar_AI_Solution/d692b74265a6ebe309118f648acea5f871129afe/CUDA-CenterPoint/3rdparty/libspconv/include/spconv/version.hpp and save to spconv_extracted/include/spconv/version.hpp

Use WebFetch to get the content and Write to save them. Make sure to preserve the exact content including all comments and formatting.

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I'll fetch and save all the specified header files from the NVIDIA CUDA-CenterPoint repository. Let me start by creating the necessary directory structure and then fetching each file.

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Now I'll fetch each header file and save it to the corresponding location:

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

I notice that some of the WebFetch responses were truncated. Let me fetch the complete content again and save each file. Let me try fetching the complete content directly by using curl to get the raw files:

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Great! Now let me verify that all the files were successfully downloaded by checking their existence and getting a brief overview of their contents:

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Perfect! Let me also verify the content of a few files to ensure they were downloaded correctly:

---

## ðŸ¤– Claude

Excellent! All six header files from the NVIDIA CUDA-CenterPoint repository have been successfully fetched and saved to the local directory structure. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Successfully Downloaded Files

All six header files have been downloaded and saved to `/home/qianxu/ai-benchmark/spconv_extracted/include/spconv/`:

1. **engine.hpp** (5,021 bytes) - Contains the main sparse convolution engine interface
2. **tensor.hpp** (5,262 bytes) - Defines tensor data structures and operations
3. **memory.hpp** (4,144 bytes) - Provides GPU memory management utilities
4. **check.hpp** (5,021 bytes) - Contains CUDA runtime error checking macros and functions
5. **timer.hpp** (2,211 bytes) - Implements GPU event-based timing utilities
6. **version.hpp** (1,639 bytes) - Defines version macros for the NVSPCONV library

## File Structure Created

```
/home/qianxu/ai-benchmark/spconv_extracted/
â””â”€â”€ include/
    â””â”€â”€ spconv/
        â”œâ”€â”€ engine.hpp

        â”œâ”€â”€ timer.hpp
        â””â”€â”€ version.hpp
```

All files have been downloaded with their complete content, including the MIT license headers, comments, and formatting exactly as they appear in the original NVIDIA repository. The files are ready for use in your project and maintain their original structure and dependencies.

Now let me check if there are any actual CUDA kernel implementations in the repository's src directory:
